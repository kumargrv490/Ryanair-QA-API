Task overview 
Feature: User management
  As an API client
  I want to manage users
  So that I can create and retrieve user data

  Scenario: Create a new user successfully
    Given I have valid user data
    When I send a POST request to "/user"
    Then I should receive a 201 response
    And the response should contain the created user's details

  Scenario: Retrieve a user by ID
    Given a user exists with ID 1
    When I send a GET request to "/user/1"
    Then I should receive a 200 response
    And the response should contain user details
